# File 1: SQL Workbench Explained in Detail

## **What is SQL Workbench?**

SQL Workbench (also known as SQL Workbench/J) is a **database administration and query tool** used to interact with SQL databases. It allows developers to:

* Connect to different SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.)
* Run SQL queries
* Create, update, and delete database objects (tables, views, triggers)
* Export and import data
* Visually inspect database schemas

It is not a database itself—it is a **client interface** to operate databases.

## **Key Features of SQL Workbench**

### ✔ **Cross‑database Support**

### ✔ **Query Editor**

Powerful editor to write and execute SQL commands.

## **Why Developers Use SQL Workbench**

* To test database queries
* To design and inspect database structure
* To debug backend database issues
* To run migrations manually

Used heavily when working with **Supabase, MySQL, Neon, PlanetScale, PostgreSQL**.

## **How SQL Workbench Connects to a Database**

1. Install SQL Workbench
2. Add database driver (e.g., MySQL driver .jar)
3. Enter connection details:

   * Host
   * Port
   * Username
   * Password
   * Database name
4. Click *Connect*

Once connected, you can run queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## **Advantages**

* Clean UI
* Works with many databases
* Lightweight

## **Disadvantages**

* Not graphical like phpMyAdmin
* Requires manual SQL writing
